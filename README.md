# Java Beginner Journey

This repository documents my learning journey with **Java**, focusing on fundamental programming concepts and classic algorithms.  
It contains small, self-contained exercises that were implemented to practice problem-solving, logical thinking, and core Java syntax.

The goal of this repository is **learning and experimentation**, not production-ready or highly optimized code.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Contains

- Basic algorithm implementations
- Practice with arrays, loops, conditionals, and methods
- Introduction to algorithmic thinking and problem decomposition
- Simple console-based Java programs

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Arrays and iteration
- Searching algorithms (e.g. Binary Search)
- Sorting algorithms (e.g. Bubble Sort, Quick Sort)
- Recursion (basic usage)
- Logical and mathematical problem-solving (e.g. Magic Square)

---

## 📂 Structure

Each `.java` file represents a **standalone exercise** focusing on a specific concept or algorithm.  
There is no shared project structure or framework setup, as the emphasis is on understanding individual problems.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A personal learning log
- A reference for fundamental Java concepts
- A foundation for progressing toward more advanced Java topics

The code may not always follow best practices or optimal performance patterns, as the primary focus is learning.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements (Optional)

- Refactoring for readability and maintainability
- Adding comments and explanations
- Introducing unit tests
- Improving algorithm efficiency

---

## 📚 Disclaimer

This repository reflects my **learning progress**.  
Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
